summary: A nice gem to have nice alert boxes in your Rails apps...
---

Small advertisement for one of my latest small Rails gem :
<a href=\"https://github.com/nicolasblanco/sweet-alert2-rails">sweet-alert2-rails</a>.
<br>
<br>
This library easily integrates the SweetAlert 2 library into a Rails application.
<br>
It replaces the boring standard JavaScript alert boxes with nice looking and animated ones.
