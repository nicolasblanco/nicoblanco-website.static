summary: How to contact a freelance developer for an employee position...
---

So you've got an interesting position for a full time employee and spotted a freelance developer you want to contact. The worst thing to do would be to contact him with just the summary of the position without custom details. When I receive a summary for a full time job with no other explanation while my profile clearly states that I'm a freelancer, the email goes directly to the trash without any answer. This shows me that the recruiter has not read my profile at all.

The nice way would be at least to acknowledge in the header message that you're aware the developer you're contacting is a freelancer.

Another great way, if you can, would be to send the summary for the full time position but explaining at the same time that you've got the possibility to begin working with the freelancer by contracting.This way it may reassure both parts in the beginning by using a classical freelancing contract before moving to a full time position if both parts are happy (of course this should not replace a sometimes mandatory and legal trial time :) ).
