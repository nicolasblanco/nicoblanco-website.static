  After almost 3 years of doing freelance web development, I received quite a lot of emails from prospects and entrepreneurs looking for a web developer.
  <br>
  <br>
  In this article I'm doing some statistics about the ways I'm being contacted.
  <br><br>
  Here are some examples of the common mistakes you should not make when trying to contact a web developer.
  <br>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>"I need a developer to work on my new great project/idea." : nope. Try to write at least one or two sentences about your project. In a future article I will write about a good project description to catch good developers.</li>
    <li>"What is your rate/estimation?" : I don't like people asking for a rate or an estimation as the single one question of a first email. I will write a full article later about this.</li>
    <li>"What is your phone/skype number? (or may I call you...)" : calling prospects when you're self employed takes too much time. It would take all my days if I had to phone every people who contact me for new work.</li>
    <li>"Need a developer to work on my PHP project." : I've stopped doing PHP development for years. By contacting me for a project which clearly uses technologies I'm not using shows that you clearly made no research at all on my profile. This kind of emails go directly to the trash :).</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <br>
  Web freelancers, how do you like to be contacted when asking for new work, what are the mistakes to avoid in priority? Entrepreneurs can write about their ideas as well :).
