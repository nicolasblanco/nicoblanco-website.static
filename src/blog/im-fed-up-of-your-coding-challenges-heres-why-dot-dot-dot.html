  Since I've returned to Europe a few months ago, I'm in a serious need of having back a stable source of revenue. For this reason I'm directly applying to startups and bigger companies all around Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  What I've found is that even if some startups advertise themselves as having a flat hierarchy and  modern hiring process, most of them have settled strict hiring processes directly inherited from the big and old corporations.
  <br>
  <br>
  When applying to some startups I thought that most of them would take a look at my experience and allow me to talk directly with their technical team. Boy I was wrong!
  <br>
  Many of them have put strict filters and steps : you first must do a meeting or Skype with their 'Talent recruiter' (or other new fancy name to define a human resources person). You're lucky if that person knows a little bit about what you're actually doing...
  <br>
  At the end of the meeting, usually this HR person tells you that the next step in order to have a second meeting with the 'technical' team is to do some coding or technical 'challenge'. Usually this challenge has been written or shamelessly copied and pasted from the Internet by their own developers.
  <br>
  At the end, this process is just a filter to only present what they think are the "interesting" candidates to the technical team or the developers. Maybe it's a way to not bother their developers for every application.
  <br>
  I may still understand this process if the candidate is junior or does not have a lot of professional experience. What is the point of asking a candidate to do this kind of things if he looks experienced, has many contributions to open source projects online and is active in some technical communities (like workshops, meetups, etc.)?
  <br>
  <br>
  Because I'm nice and easy-going I've accepted to do these 'technical challenges' the very first times I was asked without saying a word. I did some well known challenges like the <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/marsrovertechchallenge/">rover on mars exercice</a>, the <a href="https://gist.github.com/nicolasblanco/9c5e017c523e6d93d1b8d61281bddbf5">parking lot problem</a>, etc. What's funny is that I actually asked my own students during a Ruby workshop to do one of the challenges I was asked to do a few weeks ago.
  <br>
  The problem with these challenges is that they show nothing more that is already shown on an experienced developer Github account. Most of them are to check if the candidate knows the basics of Object Oriented Programming and Test Driven Development.
  <br>
  That's already the case on most of the open source contributions and gems. Contributions to open source also shows many other important values of a good developer : read code written by someone else to fix or add a feature, good understanding of a version control system like Git, continuous integration if the build is tested, communication skills to write good tickets and pull requests...
  <br>
  Now that my Github account has many "computer-school like" challenges resolved, I've decided to stop losing my personal time just to comply with an old-school hiring process.
  <br>
  <br>
  When I'm asked to do one during a hiring process, I gently ask : "What values your challenge will show to you that is not already on my Github account? May I skip this and directly talk with your developers team?".
